## the palypsate
_a race of whisperlings for [endless sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky)_

#### introduction

the palypsate are small and unique species; artificial biomechanical life now exploring the galaxy on their own for the first time—both in the flesh, and in their strangely revelatory dreams. Their mothers have left only a month ago on a grand intergalactic voyage, leaving behind the palypsate as their children, and their finest works of art. the palypsate are a quiet sort, hence their... unique typography. the palypsate have no extensive campaign—but a short collection of missions will allow one to watch these unique life-forms come to reckon with their new, independent existence and both the excitements and sorrows that this brings. 

#### history

Only a month ago, the mothers of the palypsate all left on a grand voyage to another galaxy, by methods unknown and unknowable. They left behind the palypsate, and all the little robots and equipment that nurtures them.

#### story

#### technology

the palypsate do not sell equipment like other species, though they might be persuaded to part with it in a trade. They have seen visions of strange items and aliens in their dreams—bring back some of these items and they will offer up some of the few small modules that are not integral to their selves.

palypsate technology is fun, unusual... in certain circumstances, it might even be useful! It's all very small, and it takes a while to get several items. Ideally, a player willing to trek across the galaxy to fulfil the palypsate's inconsistent musings will be rewarded with interesting little gap-fillers that can squeeze a little extra out of their builds.
