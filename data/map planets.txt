	description `This ancient and quiet world, orbiting a dim red sun, is home to the microchip foundries of House Idriss, the Arach guild that specializes in computers and advanced electronics. Outside of the cities, which are clustered around the equator, Ablub's Invention is uninhabited except by the native lifeforms, including strange, spindly-legged quadrupeds, awkward birds with leathery wings, and amphibians with webbed feet and long, whiskered snouts.`
	spaceport `The day-night cycle here is at least three times as long as any of the Coalition's species are habituated to, so the entire city enters a "false nighttime" in the middle of the day, shuttering all the windows so that the locals can rest and reset their biological clocks. And in the middle of the night, the city is brightly lit for a "false day."`
	spaceport `	The local work schedule has adapted to this unusual cycle, with the two true daytime periods serving the equivalent of the human work week, and the false daytime treated as a weekend, a time for socializing or working at home.`
