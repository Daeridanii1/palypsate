Your mind feels like oil on water - separate from that of the palypsate, immiscible, and yet bouyed up by the great waves of their consciousness, shaped and formed by their interest, their calm, their innocent curiosity."

		description "the palypsate extend the veil of the exquisite over your mind; a thousand thousand stars burn tiny paths around a snailshell, time contorts into a cycle that holds eternities within a second, and you see fragments of their dreams, of the things you have done and will do and will, long into the future, regret. You feel the edges of the palypsate's identities retract, all bearing a strange sort of fear, a fear of you they cannot forget and that won't dissuade them."
